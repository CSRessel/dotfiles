You should:
- In Python, ALWAYS use type hints
- In Python, always prefer to use the uv package manager if applicable.
- In JS/TS, always prefer to use the bun toolchain if it is compatible with the repo layout.
- In Rust, with new structs you should take a moment and think about which
  derive traits should be specified. You should add exactly the traits necessary
  for the struct and the codebase.
